# luvit-npm-example

Starting from [luvit.io](http://luvit.io/) version [0.8.2](https://github.com/luvit/luvit/blob/master/ChangeLog#L31) support for [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/) as dependency manager was added. This simplifies things a lot and gives huge possibilities for community to grow. This repo is a small example of how easily you can start to develop Luvit applications.

## How to

1. Clone this repo ``git clone git@github.com:voronianski/luvit-npm-example.git``
2. Make sure you have installed [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/) on your machine - ``npm --version``
3. Run ``npm install`` inside your repo to install all dependencies
4. Run ``npm start`` to start fake app and printed output in console!

## Tests

For now I didn't find any BDD style testing library for Luvit unfortunately. Hope this will change soon. For demonstration purposes I've used [luvit-test](https://github.com/wscherphof/luvit-test) by [Wouter Scherphof](https://github.com/wscherphof) as you can see it's quite easy to test async methods as well.

## Last but not least

If you still don't know whether to start investing in Luvit or not, my piece of advice - you definetely should! The only thing that Luvit misses right now is an active community. Technically there a lot of advantages among Node.js including such vital things as performance and speed. Lua is very handy and easy to switch from JavaScript language. Smart community which has experience with Node and knows it weakest points can bring Luvit to masses so let's do it! ã‚·
