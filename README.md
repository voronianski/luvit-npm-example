# luvit-npm-example

Starting from [luvit.io](http://luvit.io/) version [0.8.2](https://github.com/luvit/luvit/blob/master/ChangeLog#L31) support for [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/) as dependency manager was added. This simplifies things a lot and gives huge possibilities for community to grow. This repo is a small example of how easily you can start to develop Luvit applications.

## How to

1. Clone this repo ``git clone git@github.com:voronianski/luvit-npm-example.git``
2. Make sure you have installed [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/) on your machine - ``npm --version``
3. Run ``npm install`` inside your repo to install all dependencies
4. Run ``npm start`` to start fake app and printed output in console!
